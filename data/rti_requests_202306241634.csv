<p><span>Clarification on the following points may please be supplied: </span></p>

<p><span>i)Does the wording date on which he earns his next or any subsequent increment in the existing scale mean that a Government servant can opt an increment date which falls due even after the date of notification of these rules viz 29-08-2008 For example, whether a Government servant can continue in the pre-revised scale until he earns the increment which falls due in 2009 or 2010 and opt to come over to the revised scale with effect from that increment date </span></p>

<p><span>ii)If the answer to the points at (i) is in the negative, kindly make available copy of orders specifying the limit up to which option can be extended </span></p>

<p><span>iii)Does the wording until he vacates his post or ceases to draw pay in that scale include events like promotion/appointment to a post carrying higher scale of pay</span></p>

<p><span>iv)Whether such an event has to be between 01-01-2006 and 29-08-2008 for a Government servant to be eligible to opt that date for coming over to the revised scale of pay For example, whether a Government servant who has been promoted/appointed to a post carrying higher scale of pay in 2009 or 2010 opt to come over to the revised scale of pay with effect from the date of such promotion/appointment i.e. get his pay fixed in the pre-revised higher scale of promoted post and then come over to the revised scale of pay on the same date </span></p>

<br></br><br></br><h2>Response</h2> : <br></br> <p><u><strong>Point No. 1 &amp; 2:-</strong></u> The CSS (RP) Rules, 2008 came into force wie.f 1.1.2006. As per Rule 5 of the said rules an employee can opt for fixation of pay from the date of his increment in the pre-revised scale or his promotion date, which falls immediately after 1.1.2006. However, proviso 2 to Rule 5 states that in cases where a Government servant has been placed in a higher pay scale between 1.1.2006 and the date of notification of these Rules on account of promotion, upgradation of pay scale etc., the Government servant may elect to switch over to the revised pay structure from the date of such promotion, upgradation, etc.<br />
A copy of Rule 5 is enclosed<br />
<u><strong>Point No. 3 to 5:-</strong></u>. The information is clarificatory in nature. However, proviso 2 of Rule 5, as reproduced above, clarifies these points. Any further clarification requires detailed examination with reference to date of joining of the employee in Government service, etc. You may therefore, make a representation to your administrative office and in case they need any clarification, they may refer the matter to this Department.</p>

<p>Subject : - Grant of Non-Productivity Linked Bonus (ad-hoc bonus) to Central Government Employees for the year 2011-12.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">*******</p>

<p>The undersigned is directed to convey the sanction of the President to the grant of Non-Productivity Linked Bonus (Ad-hoc Bonus) equivalent to 30 days emoluments for the accounting year 2011-12 to the Central Government employees in Groups &lsquo;C&rsquo; and &#39;D&#39; and all non-gazetted employees in Group &#39;B&#39;, who are not covered by any Productivity Linked Bonus Scheme. The calculation ceiling for payment of ad-hoc Bonus under these orders shall continue to be monthly emoluments of Rs. 3500/-, as hitherto. The payment of ad&ndash;hoc Bonus under these orders will also be admissible to the eligible employees of Central Para Militrary Forces and Armed Forces. The orders will be deemed to be extended to the employees of Union Territory Administration which follow the Central Government pattern of emoluments and are not covered by any other bonus or ex-gratia scheme.</p>

<p>2. The benefit will be admissible subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>

<p>(i) Only those employees who were in service as on 31.3.2012 and have rendered at least six months of continuous service during the year 2011-12 will be eligible for payment under these orders. Pro-rata payment will be admissible to the eligible employees for period of continuous service during the year from six months to a full year, the eligibility period being taken in terms of number of months of service (rounded off to the nearest number of months).<br />
(ii) The quantum of Non-PLB (ad-hoc bonus) will be worked out on the basis of average emoluments/calculation ceiling whichever is lower. To calculate Non-PLB (Ad-hoc bonus) for one day, the average emoluments in a year will be divided by 30.4 (average number of days in a month). This will thereafter be multiplied by the number of days of bonus granted. To illustrate, taking the calculation ceiling of monthly emoluments of Rs. 3500 (where actual average emoluments exceed Rs. 3500), Non-PLB (Ad-hoc Bonus) for thirty days would work out to Rs. 3500x30/30.4=Rs.3453.95 (rounded off to Rs. 3454/-).<br />

232,29,f4767e20d116,sixth pay commission increment criteria,"<h2>Request</h2> : <br></br> <p>Sir/Madam, Before implementation of 6 CPC, for removal of pay anomalies with those of junior Government servants, the pay of senior Government Servant has to be stepped up as per GoIs decision vide Ministry of Finance O.M.No. F. 2(78) E.III (A)/66 dated 04 February 1966, which is included as GoIs decision no 18(a) under FR 22.<br />
As per this decision, the service for grant of increment of Senior Government Servant is to be reckoned from the date of stepping up of pay on par with the junior, as there was no uniform date of increment. After implementation of 6 CPC, for those employees switched over to the 6 CPC, for removal of pay anomalies with those of junior Government servants, the pay of senior Government Servant has to be stepped up as per the provisions of Note 10 below Rule 7 of CCS (RP) Rules, 2008 and increment is to be granted as per rule 10 of CCS (RP), Rules 2008.<br />
As per Rule 10 of CCS (RP), Rules 2008 due to uniform date of increment (01 July) counting of service for grant of increment is to be reckoned with reference to REVISE PAY STRUCTURE (pay band and grade pay Rule 3(7) of RPS, 2008).<br />
After stepping up of pay of senior Government Servant with reference to junior in the same pay band and grade, there is change in the BASIC PAY (pay in pay band and grade pay Rule 3(8) of RPS, 2008) not in the revised pay structure. However, administrative authorities are postponing the date of increment of senior Government Servants along with the junior Government Servant in spite of completion of six months service by senior government servant as of 01 July 2006 by quoting GoIs decision no 18(a) under FR 22. As per Rule 15 of CCS (RP), Rules 2008, the CCS (RP), Rules 2008 have overriding effect of earlier pay rules to the extent inconsistent with the revised rules.<br />
In view of the above, it may please be informed whether there exist any orders of Government for postponing the date of increment on par with junior despite completion of service by senior government servant in the REVISED PAY STRUCTURE contrary to Rule 10 of CCS (RP), Rules 2008. If so the copy of the orders may please be provided. Srinivas penke</p>

<p>i)Does the wording date on which he earns his next or any subsequent increment in the existing scale mean that a Government servant can opt an increment date which falls due even after the date of notification of these rules viz 29-08-2008 For example, whether a Government servant can continue in the pre-revised scale until he earns the increment which falls due in 2009 or 2010 and opt to come over to the revised scale with effect from that increment date</p>

<p>ii)If the answer to the points at (i) is in the negative, kindly make available copy of orders specifying the limit up to which option can be extended</p>

<p>iii)Does the wording until he vacates his post or ceases to draw pay in that scale include events like promotion/appointment to a post carrying higher scale of pay</p>

<p>iv)Whether such an event has to be between 01-01-2006 and 29-08-2008 for a Government servant to be eligible to opt that date for coming over to the revised scale of pay For example, whether a Government servant who has been promoted/appointed to a post carrying higher scale of pay in 2009 or 2010 opt to come over to the revised scale of pay with effect from the date of such promotion/appointment i.e. get his pay fixed in the pre-revised higher scale of promoted post and then come over to the revised scale of pay on the same date</p>

<p>arbitrary. The right mature before retirement, cannot be over after&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if financial up gradation is due as per ACP/MACP&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scheme before retirement and delay on part of administrative. It&nbsp;</p>

<p>cannot be denied on the ground that before the order was issued&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 are applicable for retired Govt. servant&nbsp;</p>
